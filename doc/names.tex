As you'll have guessed by now, objects name themselves.

The process happens in three steps:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item expand tokens;
  \item replace characters;
  \item apply name, overwriting if necessary.
  \end{itemize}

Each one can be configured in any \koDi\ scope with the keys.

You can control the degree of expansion; the default behaviour (no expansion)
shields you from problems with unsafe macros.
